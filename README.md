# simplecart 0.05
A simple shopping cart for ImpressCMS. Define products, add to cart, follow orders.

This version does NOT contain a payment solution, so you have to manage that yourself. There is basic status tracking for each order in the backend.

## Technology
The first version used Vue.js 3 for its shopping cart management. To minimize the overhead with the integration inside ImpressCMS, the javascript implementation for the shopping cart has now been replaced by AlpineJS.
